# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for recommending crops based on various environmental and soil features.

## Files

- **crop_data.csv1**  
  The first dataset file containing crop-related data.

- **crop_data.csv2**  
  The second dataset file containing additional crop-related data.

- **crop_recommadation.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook implementing the crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Lingu17/Crop-recommendation-using-machine-learing.git

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook crop_recommadation.ipynb
    ```

3. Ensure both `crop_data.csv1` and `crop_data.csv2` are in the same directory as the notebook.

4. Follow the notebook instructions to run the crop recommendation analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- jupyter

Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Description

The project uses machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on factors like soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The datasets (`crop_data.csv1` and `crop_data.csv2`) provide the necessary features for training and evaluating the recommendation model.
